Zenburn
=======

** This is a fork of zenburn.nvim with high contrast as supported in the original vim zenburn theme.**

A port of the venerable [Zenburn](https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn)
colorscheme to lua.

Zenburn is a low-contrast color scheme for Vim. Itâ€™s easy for your eyes and
designed to keep you in the zone for long programming sessions.

The aim of this port is to bring Zenburn into the modern age, with support for
[Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) and many
more plugins.

Contributing
------------

Pull requests are always welcome, especially for additional plugins. Please
include one or more screenshots showcasing your contribution.

Zenburn already has a rather large palette. I'm trying to avoid color bloat,
so please don't add any new colors if at all possible and refer to existing
ones instead.
